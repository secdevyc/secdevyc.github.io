<h1>POCMON</h1>

<b>User Stories:</b>
1. User should be able to type in any pokemon character and retrieve data for that character from the API
2. User should be able to click on one of the quick-keys and retrieve information for that character quickly
3. User should be able to hover over the images and there should be some animation or transformation for the images
4. User should be able to see a smaller version of the app on a smaller screen


<h2>Types of Technologies Used</h2>
I wireframed the `html` at wireframe.cc, then designed the html file from that design. 
I used `AJAX` to connect to the api, and when I succeeded in connecting, I then with Javascript and Jquery, I started to code the basic functionality of inputing a query and retrieving that specific query. After that and with some CSS, I designed the carousel that will hold/hide/show the retrieved data. I added the quick-poke buttons with icons that I found on the internet and put fuctionality on them with Jquery. I styled the final product and @media design with CSS. 

<h2>Problems</h2>
I couldn't find a 'Jigglypuff' icon.png that would post without showing the white background. 
The app works if I use the quick-pokemon first then enter another character in the form, but it doesn't work when I enter the character first and then try to use the quick-pokemon.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Type in a pokemon character name in the "Which Po" field then click "C'mon"
OR
just click on one of the quick-pokemon character icons and the app will retrieve information for that particular character. 

The app will retrieve profile pictures, abilities, items and moves for each character inputed. Click the 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons to carousel through the retrieved data.
